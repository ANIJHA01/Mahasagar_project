Steps to follow from now on : 

1. Reform the files and folder structure : 

- Backup and delete all the files from Includes folder.
- Keep only 2 files as follows : 
--- constants.php
--- config.php
--- function.php


2. Reform includes as per the decided flow.

- Flow revision : 
--- index.php 
	> constants.php 
	> config.php (Where $db is made ready) 
	> functions.php 
	> header.php 
    > {switch case will decide what page to load}
    > footer.php

- Adjust the include_once


3. Edit all the forms availbel and make sure that they all have a hidden filed named "form-name" with different value. Make sure no form has the same form-name.

4. edit the functions.php and create a class with functions to perform the oprtations from all the available forms.

5. Transcer the code from the backup includes filder files into this single functions.php file. Make sure thet are getting copied to the correct functions in the class.

6. Test all the forms.
