Steps to follow from now on : 

1. Reform the files and folder structure : 

- Backup and delete all the files from Includes folder.
- Keep only 2 files as follows : 
--- constants.php
--- config.php
--- function.php


2. Reform includes as per the decided flow.

- Flow revision : 
--- index.php 
	> constants.php 
	> config.php (Where $db is made ready) 
	> functions.php 
	> header.php 
    > {switch case will decide what page to load}
    > footer.php

- Adjust the include_once


3. Edit all the forms availbel and make sure that they all have a hidden filed named "form-name" with different value. Make sure no form has the same form-name.

4. edit the functions.php and create a class with functions to perform the oprtations from all the available forms.

5. Transcer the code from the backup includes filder files into this single functions.php file. Make sure thet are getting copied to the correct functions in the class.

6. Test all the forms.



Table - "mhs_meta"
    |- id
    |- meta_key
    |- meta_value
    |- desc

============================================

id      |       meta_key        |       meta_value      |       desc

1       |     banner_ad_img     |           null        |       null

============================================

SELECT meta_value FROM mhs_meta WHERE meta_key = banner_ad_img;

UPDATE mhs_meta SET meta_value = $file_name WHERE meta_key = banner_ad_img;

UPDATE mhs_meta SET meta_value = '' WHERE meta_key = banner_ad_img;

Strategy for Implementing a Commenting: 
============================================
1. Setup the Comment Section:
    Create input fields for:
        User Name       |       User Email      |       Comment Text
    Design and edit the Submit Button:
        |-Add animations or visual effects to enhance user experience.
        |-Assign the form a unique identifier, such as userComment, to differentiate it from other forms on the site.

============================================
2. Handle the Submit Button Functionality:
    When the submit button is clicked:
        |-The form data is sent using the POST method.
        |-The request will be processed in the includes folder in a file named handle_request.php.
        |-Inside handle_request.php, use a switch-case structure based on the form_name field to handle different types of requests.
============================================
3. Create a Function to Save Comments:
    Inside the includes folder, create a file named Comments.php.
    Define a function named userComment in this file:
        |-Fetch the user’s name, email, and comment from the POST request.
        |-Insert this data into the database table named article_comments.
============================================
4. Database Table Structure:
    Table Name: article_comments
    Columns:
        |-id (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
        |-article_name (User’s Name)
        |-article_email (User’s Email)
        |-article_comment (Comment Text)
        |-created_at (Timestamp of when the comment was added)
============================================
5. Final Implementation Workflow:
    1. User fills out the comment form and clicks the Submit button.
    2. The form sends data via POST to handle_request.php in the includes folder.
    3. The handle_request.php file identifies the form_name as userComment and email the corresponding function in Comments.php.
    4. The userComment function in Comments.php processes the data and saves it to the article_comments database table.
